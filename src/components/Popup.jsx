          Combine tiles of the same number in an attempt to create a tile with
          the value 2048. <br />
          <br />
          Pressing the arrow keys or swiping across the game board will move all
          tiles in the direction of the key pressed/swipe. After all the tiles
          are done moving a new tile with the value of 2 or 4 will be created in
          a random empty cell. <br />
          <br /> Two tiles with the same number will merge when they collide to
          create a single tile with double the value. <br />
          <br />
          The game is over when there are no valid ways for you to move the
          tiles.
